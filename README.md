DECISIONS
===============
I mocked a faked graphql Api using fake-graphql library. I installed it globally using command yarn add globally fake-graphql and opened it on a local host graphql editor.
This enabled the graphql schema  to be saved locally on the root of this application.
I created a grouped multidimensional array data structure of JSON  using grapql faker .
This structure was in the same shape with the wireframe design.
